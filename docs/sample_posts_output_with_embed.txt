      "rendered": "<p>Today is Indigenous People&#8217;s Day.</p>\n<p>This day is still called Columbus Day in much of the U.S. You might think of it as a holiday. Or maybe it&#8217;s a day to <a href=\"http://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2016/10/06/columbus-day-sales-are-everywhere-already/21576050/\" target=\"_blank\">shop for sales</a>. Some cities even <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/in-transit/Columbus-Day-Parade-festivals-and-beer-run-to-close-city-streets-this-weekend.html\" target=\"_blank\">celebrate it with parades</a>.</p>\n<p>At MyDomino, we think this is a great day to focus on indigenous people &#8212; and clean energy.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Native Americans as solar trailblazers</h2>\n<p>Why is that? Because, as it turns out, Native Americans are becoming big adopters of solar energy.</p>\n<p>This is nothing new. Back in 2013, Native Americans were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/native-american-tribes-solar-power\" target=\"_blank\">already considered solar trailblazers</a>. Some had even been <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2014/0701/How-some-Native-Americans-are-embracing-renewable-energy\">installing solar since 1987</a>.</p>\n<p>It makes a lot of sense. Many Native tribes, especially in western states, live in sunny areas. They also tend to have high unemployment rates and high energy costs. Some of them aren&#8217;t even connected to an electric grid at all.</p>\n<p>Solar power can help with all these issues.</p>\n<h2>Clean, affordable electricity</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret to anyone reading this blog that the <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/cheap-solar-power-now/\">cost of solar has been plummeting</a>. That makes it a great option for people with low incomes and high power costs.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the only reason solar is a great fit for tribal nations.</p>\n<p>Did you know that thousands of Native Americans have <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/04/21/401000427/solar-power-makes-electricity-more-accessible-on-navajo-reservation\" target=\"_blank\">no electricity in their homes</a>? That&#8217;s right &#8212; people right here in the U.S. are living without something that most of us take for granted.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s extremely expensive to build new power lines, so that keeps more electricity from coming to these low-income areas. Solar power with battery storage, or operating in a micro-grid, is made to order!</p>\n<p>Add to that the fact that reservations have for years been dumping grounds for nuclear and other toxic waste &#8212; and clean solar power becomes even more appealing.</p>\n<h2>Solar jobs</h2>\n<p>Solar installations can also bring much-needed jobs to tribal lands. As the <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/rise-of-solar-power/\">fastest-growing industry</a> in the country (growing <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/work/2016/01/solar-job-growth-american-economy-marco-rubio/424035/\" target=\"_blank\">12 times faster</a> than the rest of the economy), solar is a proven job creator.</p>\n<p>As more solar is installed, more local jobs are created. And some of the programs bringing solar to reservations are also providing job training.</p>\n<p>GRID Alternatives, a nonprofit that makes clean energy accessible to underserved communities, runs a <a href=\"http://www.gridalternatives.org/programs/tribal-program\" target=\"_blank\">Tribal Program</a> that installs solar for tribal member families and also trains tribal members in solar installation. GRID Alternatives also started a <a href=\"http://www.pvsolarreport.com/grid-alternatives-and-wells-fargo-team-up-for-veterans/\" target=\"_blank\">Native American Veterans Initiative</a>. This program brings solar and job training to a population that serves in the military at a higher per capita rate than any other ethnic group in the country.</p>\n<p>Another nonprofit, Solar Energy International, runs a <a href=\"http://www.solarenergy.org/native-american-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">Native American Communities Outreach Program</a>. Their program helps Native Americans with clean energy, and also trains people from a number of tribes in clean energy technologies.</p>\n<h2>A win-win</h2>\n<p>Accessible clean energy, electric bill savings, jobs &#8212; it all adds up to a big win for Native Americans. And clean solar power helps all of us by keeping our air and water cleaner, too. That has <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/how-solar-power-is-saving-lives-and-saving-money/\">huge health benefits</a> for our families and our communities &#8212; health benefits that also translate to dollar savings.</p>\n<p>So on this Indigenous People&#8217;s Day, let&#8217;s celebrate that solar is coming to more people. It&#8217;s only fitting that it should be available to the first people who inhabited our country.</p>\n<span class=\"rad_rapidology_bottom_trigger\"></span>",

      "rendered": "<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, October is <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/campus-sustainability-month/\" target=\"_blank\">Campus Sustainability Month</a>. It&#8217;s not-so-coincidentally timed alongside <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/energy-awareness-month/\">National Energy Awareness Month</a>.</p>\n<p>For the month of October, colleges across the country are hosting events to promote sustainability on campus and beyond. The events are targeted to incoming students and are meant to inspire them to become leaders in sustainability.</p>\n<h2>What can you do as a student?</h2>\n<p>Are you a student? If so, you might not be able to make the switch to solar &#8212; but there&#8217;s still plenty of things you <strong>can</strong> do.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/smarten-your-home-with-power-strips/\">adding a smart power strip</a> to your electronics will ensure you&#8217;re not wasting power when your devices are switched off.</p>\n<p>Swapping out incandescent light bulbs with more efficient <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/leds-vs-cfls/\">LED light bulbs</a> will save you even more energy. Plus, you won&#8217;t need to change the bulbs throughout the year. You can even take them with you at the end of the year and use them in your new place!</p>\n<p>Sustainability isn&#8217;t just about saving energy. Choosing what you eat can actually have a big impact on our world. This is an easy way for you to do your part. By <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/whats-the-best-way-to-eat/\">reducing the amount of meat</a> you eat, you can up your sustainability impact. And <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/10-tips-to-reduce-food-waste/\">minimizing your food waste</a> can make sure good food doesn&#8217;t end up rotting in a landfill. This is one time a student&#8217;s big stomach can actually come in handy!</p>\n<h2>What can your family do?</h2>\n<p>Even if you can&#8217;t go solar, your parents might be able to. By learning about the benefits of solar, you can help educate your family about it. Family members who&#8217;ve never given solar any thought may end up becoming enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>That said, we don&#8217;t expect you to become a solar expert &#8212; although it would be great if you did!</p>\n<p>If your family members are intrigued by solar and want to learn more, they can read up about it in our <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/solar-101/\">Solar 101</a>. It goes through all of the aspects of a solar system and things to consider when making the switch.</p>\n<p>People in your family can also contact a <a href=\"https://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_CampusSustainabilityMonth\">MyDomino energy savings concierge</a>. Their concierge can answer any questions they have and help them determine is solar is right for them.</p>\n<p>And if solar won&#8217;t work for them, a <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/clean-power-plan-for-everyone/\">clean power plan</a> may be an excellent option to clean up their energy. It could even be a good option for you, if you&#8217;re a student living off-campus and paying a power bill!</p>\n<h2>Learn more about Campus Sustainability Month</h2>\n<p>Not every college is hosting events for Campus Sustainability Month. If you&#8217;d like to find out if a school near you is hosting one, check out <a href=\"http://www.aashe.org/campus-sustainability-month/\" target=\"_blank\">aashe.org</a>. They&#8217;ve got a full list of participating colleges, plus the specific events that will be taking place at each school.</p>\n<p>If there isn&#8217;t a participating school near you, don&#8217;t worry.

After learning about the dangers of global warming in elementary school, Brian knew that he wanted to make a difference. Brian is particularly interested in how renewable energy technologies can be used to reduce carbon emissions. This brought him to San Francisco, where he began writing for PV Solar Report. He was subsequently published on Solar Power World and The Energy Collective. Brian is now expanding his work to all things clean energy with MyDomino.",

It&#8217;s a time to give energy the credit it deserves!</p>\n<p>Most of us rarely think about energy, yet we rely on it every single day. <strong>Imagine not having energy in your life</strong>. You wouldn&#8217;t be able to drink your morning coffee, take your hot shower — or even read this blog post. And that&#8217;s just for starters.<!--more--></p>\n<p>At MyDomino, energy is what we’re all about — clean energy and saving energy, that is. And guess what: both of those can <strong>save you big bucks</strong>. It’s a win-win-win!</p>\n<h2>Where do you start?</h2>\n<p>You might be thinking, &#8220;This sounds like a good idea, but where do I even begin?&#8221; As the Energy Awareness Month name suggests, the first step is awareness.</p>\n<p>Most of us really aren&#8217;t aware of all our energy consumption. We turn on the lights and use our appliances, but we don&#8217;t think much about where the power comes from, or how much of it we&#8217;re using.</p>\n<p>Did you know, for example, that if your home is like the average American’s, you could be <a href=\"http://www.mydomino.com/blog/how-you-can-save-over-100-a-year-in-5-minutes/\">wasting as much energy each day</a> as it would take to brew <strong>234 cups of coffee? </strong>That&#8217;s right, each day. And that&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>\n<p>So, being aware of the energy drains in your home is a good first step. You can start by finding out how much power your electronics and appliances are using in the first place. To do this, you might want to try out the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/P3-P4400-Electricity-Usage-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444071956&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=P3+P4400+Kill+A+Watt+Electricity+Usage+Monitor\" target=\"_blank\">KillaWatt</a> power monitor. This little device can give you a lot of useful information about your home&#8217;s energy use.</p>\n<p>What do you do once you have this information? If you want to start small, check out our post on <a href=\"http://www.mydomino.com/blog/6-free-ways-to-save-money-and-energy/\">6 free ways to save money and energy</a>. Simple actions like washing your laundry in cold water can <strong>save you more than you might think</strong>.</p>\n<h2>More steps you can take</h2>\n<p>Maybe you want to do a bit more. To <strong>take care of energy drains</strong>, you can cluster appliances and electronics with a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st_relevancerank?keywords=smart+power+strip&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=n%3A172282%2Cn%3A541966%2Cn%3A172456%2Cn%3A761520%2Ck%3Asmart+power+strip&amp;qid=1433291532&amp;sort=relevancerank\">smart power strip</a> &#8212; and enjoy those extra cups of coffee. Switching to LED bulbs is another great way to save more than you might expect.

Even if you can&#8217;t put solar on your roof, you may be able to <a href=\"http://www.mydomino.com/blog/community-solar-popular/\">buy panels that are installed somewhere else</a>.

      "rendered": "<p>If you&#8217;ve been wanting to save money while also saving energy, we have good news. You can start with some quick and easy actions that won&#8217;t cost you a dime! With just a little bit of time and minimal effort, you can take advantage of these free savings.<!--more--></p>\n<h2><strong>1. Turn a knob and save hundreds a year</strong></h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever put your hands under the hot water tap and instantly felt a painful burn, you likely have your hot water turned up way higher than it needs to be. Now, most people don’t know much about their water heaters, but these appliances are very easy to adjust. If your water is too hot, simply turning the water heater down to 120 degrees (or medium) will not only save you energy &#8212; it will be safer, too. <em>Note</em>: If you have a compromised immune system, you should leave the setting at 140 degrees.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Wash your laundry in cold water</strong></h2>\n<p>Continuing the theme of water, did you know that modern laundry detergents are designed to work equally well with cold or hot water? By <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/will-washing-in-cold-water-clean-laundry/\">washing your laundry in cold water</a>, you&#8217;re saving energy to heat the water, and your clothes come out just as clean. You might even extend the life of your clothes.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Give line-drying a try</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have the time and space for it, line-drying your clothes will also help by cutting the dryer completely out of the equation. Since a clothes dryer accounts for 12% of electricity use in the typical household, the extra effort could be worth it.</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Run large appliances at night</strong></h2>\n<p>Depending on where you live, it can pay to run large appliances during off-hours, like at night. Some electric companies charge you more for electricity during peak-use times. By shifting to lower-use times, you&#8217;ll spend less money for your electricity. This can be especially effective for appliances like your washer, dryer, and dishwasher.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Make the most of your thermostat</strong></h2>\n<p>Your thermostat controls 50% of your home&#8217;s power. Make the most of this by ensuring you&#8217;re setting it properly. If you own a programmable thermostat, set it for all 7 days of the week. Even if you have an old-fashioned manual thermostat, turn it down at night and when you&#8217;re away to save energy when you can. These changes can <strong>save you up to $150 a year</strong> and keep you more comfortable.</p>\n<h2><strong>6. Save up to $1 a gallon with simple driving changes</strong></h2>\n<p>No matter what type of vehicle you drive, you can likely improve its mileage, and save money, by practicing <em>hypermiling</em>. That basically means driving in a way that maximizes your gas mileage. Slowly accelerating and braking, avoiding idling and air conditioner use, and properly maintaining your vehicle will all help you go farther on a tank of gas. Check out our <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/improve-gas-mileage-hypermiling/\">hypermiling blog post</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Every little bit helps</h2>\n<p>Whether you choose to take some or all of these actions, each one can help. And hey, it costs you nothing, so any savings go straight to your pocketbook.</p>\n<p>For more ways to save energy and money, <strong>contact a <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_6EasyWaysSave\" target=\"_blank\">MyDomino energy savings concierge</a></strong> today.

After learning about the dangers of global warming in elementary school, Brian knew that he wanted to make a difference. Brian is particularly interested in how renewable energy technologies can be used to reduce carbon emissions. This brought him to San Francisco, where he began writing for PV Solar Report. He was subsequently published on Solar Power World and The Energy Collective. Brian is now expanding his work to all things clean energy with MyDomino.",

But what if you can’t afford major home improvements? Or what if you’re a renter? As a MyDomino energy savings concierge, I get this kind of question a lot.<!--more--></p>\n<p>The good new is, any of us can take simple actions to save energy and money &#8212; and make our homes a little smarter in the process. </p>\n<h2>Vanquish the vampires</h2>\n<p>“Smart homes” are quite the buzz these days. And the term can mean a lot of things. I’ll start with a simple action that&#8217;s also the smartest thing you can do to save energy in your home. It involves killing off <a href=\"http://www.mydomino.com/blog/how-you-can-save-over-100-a-year-in-5-minutes/\">vampire energy loads</a> &#8212; the power that your appliances are draining even when you’re not using them. </p>\n<p>An easy way to vanquish the vampires is to plug your appliances into <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60461.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">smart strips</a>. These power strips won’t stop all energy use, like a traditional power strip would if you turned it off or unplugged it. But they have the benefit of being easier to control, so you&#8217;re more likely to turn off devices. </p>\n<p>You can choose from several kinds of smart strips. Here are the best of each main type.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1232\" src=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin-241x300.jpg\" alt=\"belkin\" width=\"200\" height=\"249\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin-241x300.jpg 241w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin-768x957.jpg 768w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin-822x1024.jpg 822w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin-610x760.jpg 610w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/belkin.jpg 1204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></a>Remote-switch power strips</h2>\n<p>Remote-switch power strips have one or two “always on” plugs, for devices you want to ensure stay on, and usually three times as many “easy off” plugs. You can turn off unused devices by flipping a switch on the strip itself, or sometimes even using a remote. A top-of-the-line remote-switch power strip is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Conserve-Switch%C2%81-Protector-F7C01008q/dp/B003P2UMNK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439493675&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Belkin+Conserve+Switch%C2%81+Surge+Protector\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin Conserve Switch Surge Protector with Remote</a>.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Master-controlled power strips</h2>\n<p>Like the remote-switch variety, master-controlled power strips have several “always on” plugs for your DVR and other devices you don’t want to cut off power to. They also have a “control plug,” which senses when more energy is being pulled from a device that&#8217;s plugged in and turns on &#8212; like when you turn on the TV with your remote.

This is a great feature if you know you won&#8217;t be using devices during certain times, or if you&#8217;d like to have devices like lights turn on automatically at certain times.

When a significant amount of power is not being called for, the whole strip powers down, to ensure the vampire load is kept to a minimum. A downside of these strips is that if they detect a large enough drop in energy use, they might cut power to devices you are using. They&#8217;re also some of the most expensive power strips on the market.

      "rendered": "<p>Winter is not so far away. Even here in California, we&#8217;re starting to feeling an autumn chill in the air. What better time to take control of that small appliance in your home with an outsized impact? That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re talking about your thermostat. This little thing <strong>controls 50% of your power bill</strong>!</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Heating is the <strong>largest home energy bill for most Americans</strong>. When you add cooling to that, your thermostat controls more energy than all your lighting, appliances, and electronics combined.</p>\n<h2>What about a programmable thermostat?</h2>\n<p>One way to take control and slash your power bill is by programming your thermostat. If you have a programmable thermostat, you can set it to turn down your heating or cooling at night, and when you&#8217;re away. It&#8217;s also important to set it for all 7 days of the week.</p>\n<p>So why go to the next level and get a smart thermostat? If you&#8217;re like most Americans, you probably aren&#8217;t using your programmable thermostat to its full advantage.</p>\n<p>In fact, almost <strong>90% of people who have a programmable thermostat are not using it effectively &#8212; or even using it at all</strong>. That&#8217;s according to a <a href=\"http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/1963.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">study sponsored by the Department of Energy</a>.  The study found that many people use their programmable thermostat as an &#8220;on-off switch.&#8221; Most people don&#8217;t fully learn how to use the device. And a full 89% rarely or never use it to set a weekday or weekend program.</p>\n<h2>Let a smart thermostat do the work for you</h2>\n<p>As an on-off switch, a programmable thermostat just isn&#8217;t paying its way. It&#8217;s no better than its manual counterpart.</p>\n<p>A <strong>smart thermostat</strong>, on the other hand, is effective because it does the work for you. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; most of us are too busy, and have too much on our minds, to take full advantage of a regular programmable thermostat.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what a smart thermostat can do for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn your preferences</strong> and adjust your home temperature to your lifestyle.</li>\n<li><strong>Detect things like humidity changes</strong> or an oven being turned on, and adjust itself to keep you comfortable.</li>\n<li><strong>Adjust to your schedule changes</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower your heating or air conditioning</strong> when you’re away or asleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Let you see how much you’re spending</strong> on heating and cooling, tweak its programming, and instantly see your savings.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep you from having to think about it</strong>!</li>\n<li><strong>Save you <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/how-much-can-a-smart-thermostat-save-you/\">$100+ a year</a></strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A smart thermostat does all this while still letting you control it when you want to. You can even control the thermostat remotely when you’re not home.</p>\n<p>Plus &#8212; we have to admit it &#8212; smart thermostats are just cool! We have one in our office and love playing with it.</p>\n<h2>How do you pick the right smart thermostat?</h2>\n<p>With more smart thermostats on the market all the time, you may be wondering how to make the choice. <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/which-smart-thermostat-should-you-get/\">Check out our handy guide</a> to see which of the top contenders is right for you.</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t hesitate to check in with your <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_WhySmartThermostat\" target=\"_blank\">MyDomino energy savings concierge</a>.

But there&#8217;s a really simple thing you may not have considered &#8212; something you may already be doing.</p>\n<p>It turns out that <strong>a great way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is simply riding a bike</strong>.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>You know these benefits of biking</h2>\n<p>Most of us ride bikes for reasons like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bike riding is fun!</strong> More Americans <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/03/news/study-103-7-million-americans-ride-bikes_362019\" target=\"_blank\">ride bikes for recreation</a> than for any other reason.</li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s a great way to get fit.</strong> You get the <a href=\"http://www.healthywomen.org/content/article/benefits-bike-riding\" target=\"_blank\">same cardiovascular benefits</a> from biking as from other aerobic exercises. But biking is easier on your body than exercises like running. And it&#8217;s an easier exercise to fit into your day if you&#8217;re using it to get somewhere you have to go anyway.</li>\n<li><strong>Biking can be the best way to get around in crowded cities. </strong>Cycling is usually the <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3054052/how-far-can-you-get-in-5-minutes-on-a-bike-this-app-will-tell-you\" target=\"_blank\">fastest way to travel</a> in a city for trips of up to 6 miles. You don&#8217;t have to worry about parking. And you&#8217;re <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3046054/want-to-reduce-stress-at-work-try-commuting-by-bike\" target=\"_blank\">40% less likely to be tense</a> in the hour after arriving at work on a bike than if you drive or take public transit.</li>\n<li><strong>It saves money.</strong> It almost goes without saying that <a href=\"http://www.bicyclesource.com/you/commuting/why-cyclocommute.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">bikes are much cheaper</a> to buy and operate than cars &#8212; <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/what-i-learned-test-riding-e-bikes/\">even electric bikes</a>! Bike riding is usually also cheaper than taking public transportation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>You can help save the planet, too</h2>\n<p>We don&#8217;t necessarily think about saving the planet when we saddle up. But biking is one of the greenest ways to get around, second only to walking. That&#8217;s significant because transportation is the second-biggest contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions, after energy generation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ecf.com/wp-content/uploads/ECF_CO2_WEB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A 2011 study</a> by the European Cycling Federation compared the average emissions for bikes to other kinds of transportation. The study looked at the environmental cost of manufacturing bikes, as well as their actual use. Even assuming an average bike weight of a rather heavy 40+ pounds, the study found these emission rates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regular bikes</strong>: About 33 grams of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per mile</li>\n<li><strong>Electric bikes</strong>: 45g/mile</li>\n<li><strong>Buses</strong>: 158g/mile per passenger</li>\n<li><strong>Cars</strong>: 423g/mile per person</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These numbers show what a difference our daily choices can make. Even choosing to bike a couple days a week can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. If you go all-in and bike to work for a year, it&#8217;s like planting over 30 trees.</p>\n<p>When more of us take to our bikes, we can make an even bigger difference &#8212; what we like to call a MyDomino Effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-Global-High-Shift-Cycling-Scenario_Nov-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">According to a study</a> by the Institute for Transportation &amp; Development Policy and the University of California, Davis, a dramatic increase in biking could save our world $24 trillion cumulatively between 2015 and 2050. It would also <strong>cut CO2 emissions in 2050 by nearly 11%</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Why start biking now?</h2>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t been biking as part of your daily life, this might be just the time to take it up. Biking is becoming more popular in the U.S, with cities around the country — from Cincinnati to Salt Lake City to San Francisco — adding bike lanes. Many of these are <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/16/cities-add-protected-bike-lanes/1839613/\" target=\"_blank\">protected lanes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.com/blog/whats-so-great-about-electric-bikes/\">Electric bikes</a> are becoming more available, making it even easier to bike. They provide the convenience of a bicycle, with the added benefit of being self-powered.</p>\n<p>Even with winter not too far off, you can still make good use of your bike with <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/winter-coming-how-ride-your-bike-it.html\" target=\"_blank\">these simple tips</a>.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s stopping you?

      "rendered": "<p>UPDATED 9/29/16</p>\n<p>Smartphone power use may not be on your mind every day. But when you do think about how much power your smartphone uses, your mind most likely goes to the time you spend charging your phone. In reality, 80% of the energy usage in a gadget&#8217;s lifetime happens outside of the time it spends in its owner&#8217;s hands.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Your phone&#8217;s true cost</h2>\n<p>Wrap your head around that &#8212; the daily power usage of a smartphone or tablet over years of ownership accounts for only 20% of the device&#8217;s total power usage! When you combine this with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/23/were-are-all-losers-to-gadget-industry-built-on-planned-obsolescence\" target=\"_blank\">planned &#8220;self-destruction&#8221;</a> used to increase product demand, it’s easy to see how quickly <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/materials/ecycling/infographic/pdf/smart_phone_infographic.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the environmental cost</a> of buying new gadgets adds up.</p>\n<p>To begin with, there are lots of rare earth elements used to create smartphones, and only a few places in the world to obtain them. The mining and byproducts of these materials uses a lot of energy, and has a huge impact on the planet. Take, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150402-the-worst-place-on-earth\" target=\"_blank\">toxic sludge lake in Mongolia</a> or deforestation from mining in the Congo.</p>\n<p>Once these rare materials are extracted, they must be processed, then used in production at a factory. Depending on the country of origin, environmental manufacturing policies may vary. Once the device is ready for sale, it must then be transported to the distributors, most likely using dirty fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>That’s a long journey before it ends up in your hands! So what can you do to reduce your smartphone&#8217;s impact on the environment?</p>\n<h2>Smart purchasing</h2>\n<p>It’s a cultural phenomenon to chase after the shiniest new gizmo. But you can have the biggest impact by making smart buying decisions. Focus on <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/leyla_acaroglu_paper_beats_plastic_how_to_rethink_environmental_folklore?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">sustainably designed</a> gadgets. Look for hardware with a long shelf life, made from recycled materials. It&#8217;s best if it can be easily disassembled. To avoid buying new devices frequently, look for devices that can be improved with software updates, or by replacing parts. Innovative companies like <a href=\"http://www.puzzlephone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Puzzlephone</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/21/12244300/motorola-moto-z-review-droid-moto-mod\" target=\"_blank\">Lenovo</a>, are introducing modular phones with replaceable parts. <a href=\"https://www.fairphone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fairphone</a> is a brand dedicated to reducing the harmful consequences of rare earth mining.</p>\n<h2>Mobile maintenance</h2>\n<p>Once you own a device, try to extend its lifespan. Take <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a15731/best-way-to-keep-li-ion-batteries-charged/\" target=\"_blank\">proper care of the lithium-ion batteries</a> used in most mobile or internet-enabled devices. Keep the device away from high heat, which has a tendency to damage the battery. Invest in <a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/best-rugged-smartphones-2014/33474/\" target=\"_blank\">adequate protection</a> so you don’t accidentally break the device. See if you can repair parts when needed, rather than replacing the entire gadget.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can run the device off of clean energy sources. If you’re unable to <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/solar-101/\">power your entire home</a> with solar, look into a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/WakaWaka-Power-Solar-Charger-Yellow/dp/B00OM1JJ3W%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAJQZCTRPP2KFB6YZA%26tag%3Ddomino09d-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%B00OM1JJ3W\">solar phone charger</a>!</p>\n<h2>Proper disposal</h2>\n<p>Historically, about <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/08/01/e-waste-in-developing-countries-endangers-environment-locals\" target=\"_blank\">23% of of the developed world&#8217;s</a> e-waste has ended up in developing countries. There, it contaminates the land, water, and air. Those devices that don&#8217;t go abroad end up in domestic landfills, or sit unused in desk drawers. Once the day comes when you must part with your device, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/smart_phone_infographic_v4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">proper disposal</a> is incredibly important.</p>\n<p>Make sure to terminate your service, clear the memory, remove SIM cards, and send or deliver the device to a <a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/recycle/electronics-donation-and-recycling\" target=\"_blank\">certified technology recycling facility</a>. This important step helps reduce the amount of material extraction required to start the production process all over again!</p>\n<span class=\"rad_rapidology_bottom_trigger\"></span>",

And in California, household water use accounts for a small fraction of the state&#8217;s water.</p>\n<p>In fact, an astonishing 80% of California&#8217;s water goes to one thing: agriculture. Even in states that aren&#8217;t as big on farming, agriculture is a huge water hog.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Automated-Farming-Irrigation-S-105112352.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3071\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Automated-Farming-Irrigation-S-105112352.jpg\" alt=\"conserve water\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" /></a></p>\n<h1>The beef factor</h1>\n<p>What can you do? It turns out the answer is simple. With one easy change, you can save a lot of water: just <strong>eat less beef</strong>.</p>\n<p>Beef is one of the biggest water users in agriculture. It takes an amazing amount of water to grow one pound of beef. We&#8217;ve seen estimates from <a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/food-water-footprint/\" target=\"_blank\">1700</a> to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@lesliejz/don-t-stop-showering-california-lay-off-the-burgers-and-nuts-and-pick-up-some-crickets-eb63bddf0277\" target=\"_blank\">2500</a> gallons per pound. So let&#8217;s stay on the conservative side and say it takes about 1800 gallons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beyondfossilfuels.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/beef.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1524 size-full\" src=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/beef.jpg\" width=\"544\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/beef.jpg 544w, http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/beef-300x149.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" /></a></p>\n<p>To put it in perspective, a 10-minute shower uses 25 gallons of water. If you shower every day, that&#8217;s 9125 gallons a year &#8212; about what it takes to grow 5 pounds of beef (or 3.5 pounds with less conservative estimates).</p>\n<blockquote><p>The upshot? <strong>You can save more water by not eating a few pounds of beef than by not showering for a year.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Which sounds easier to you?</p>\n<h1>How beef stacks up</h1>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at a few common water-conserving recommendations and how they stack up to cutting back on beef.</p>\n<p>Of course it makes sense to take these actions. But if you just enjoy your long showers too much, consider whether you really need that burger or can choose another tasty option.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 657px;\" width=\"563\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\"><strong>Action &#8230;</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\"><strong>avg gallons of<br />\nwater saved/year</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\"><strong>= pounds of beef/year<br />\n(at 1800 gal/lb)<br />\n</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\">Cut 10-min showers to 5 min</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\">About 4550 gal/year</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\">2.53 lb/year (just 10 quarter-pounders!)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\">Wash full loads of laundry &amp; dishes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\">2600</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\"> 1.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\">Flush only when necessary</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\">2738, if flush 5 times/day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\"> 1.52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\">Turn off water while brushing teeth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\">1825, if brush 2x/day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\"> 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\">Water lawn 1-2 days/week instead of 5 days</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\">40,000</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\"> 22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"180\">Clean driveways and sidewalks with broom</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"150\">7800, if clean once a week</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100\"> 4.3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In other words, if you pass on just a few burgers, you can do as much as if you took short showers, flushed only as needed, and took a broom to your driveway.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean you should water your lawn with abandon. But it shows the difference you can make with just your food choices.</p>\n<h1>Even more benefits</h1>\n<p>The benefits don&#8217;t end there. It turns out what&#8217;s good for water conservation is also good for you.</p>\n<p>A federal report found that a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/regulation/237767-vegan-diet-best-for-planet-federal-report-says\" target=\"_blank\">plant-based diet is healthier</a> for both people and planet. There are so many health benefits &#8212; and so many new options coming out, like the <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/food/1.743774\" target=\"_blank\">Impossible Burger</a>.</p>\n<p>The good news is, <strong>you don&#8217;t have to go vegan</strong> to start conserving water. As you can see, cutting back on just a few burgers is a great way to have an epic impact.</p>\n<span class=\"rad_rapidology_bottom_trigger\"></span>",

      "rendered": "<p>Are you tired of this year&#8217;s divisive election season? Had enough of our increasingly polarized political landscape?</p>\n<p>If so, you&#8217;re not alone. And you might be glad to know there&#8217;s <strong>one thing most of us can agree on</strong>: clean, green energy.</p>\n<p>Clean energy is often portrayed by the media as a contentious topic. But this is becoming increasingly untrue &#8212; with everyone from Pope Francis to President Obama to Tea Party Republicans getting on board with clean energy.<!--more--></p>\n<p>The term &#8220;green energy&#8221; may still trigger thoughts of environmentalists pushing for an ideal with no regard to cost. But that ignores the reality of the changing energy market we see all around us.</p>\n<h2>Green energy can compete</h2>\n<p>Many Americans still believe that clean energy is more expensive than dirty fuels like coal and natural gas. That used to be true. But times are changing &#8212; fast.</p>\n<p>Thanks to prices continually dropping, <strong>clean energy can now <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/cheap-solar-power-now/\">more than compete with dirty fuels</a></strong>. Clean energy sources now make up the vast majority of our nation&#8217;s new power generation. In January of this year, for example, solar and wind were the <strong>only</strong> sources of <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/clean-energy-is-beating-dirty-fuel/\">new generating capacity in the U.S.</a></p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just because these energy sources are &#8220;green.&#8221; These days, they&#8217;re often <strong>the most cost-effective options</strong>.</p>\n<h2>It appeals to both sides of the aisle</h2>\n<p>Green energy doesn&#8217;t just appeal to environmentalists. Even Tea Party members are <a href=\"http://grist.org/politics/this-green-tea-party-star-is-fighting-for-solar/\" target=\"_blank\">actively fighting </a>for clean energy sources like solar.</p>\n<p>That charge is being led by one of the Tea Party founders, Debbie Dooley, who created an organization called <a href=\"http://energyfreedomusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Conservatives for Energy Freedom</a>. Dooley also joined forces with the Sierra Club in Georgia to form the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/green-tea-party-solar\" target=\"_blank\">Green Tea Coalition </a>&#8212; to fight for solar. These groups may not care about combatting climate change, but they do care about <strong>giving Americans a choice in where they get their energy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Motivated by similar free-market leanings, Republican politician Barry Goldwater Jr. heads an organization called <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/07/barry-goldwater-tusk-arizona-solar-net-metering\" target=\"_blank\">Tell Utilities Solar Won&#8217;t Be Killed</a> (T.U.S.K.). That organization has been a major force in advocating for solar customers in Arizona.</p>\n<p>Republican mayors from <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/greenhouse/2013/04/13/greensburg-kansas/2078901/\" target=\"_blank\">Kansas</a> to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/05/13/can-a-city-get-to-net-zero-lancaster-california-mayor-thinks-so/\" target=\"_blank\">California</a> are greening up their towns &#8212; because they care about their children&#8217;s future, and <strong>because it saves money</strong>. The people of Greensburg, Kansas &#8212; a town that was leveled by a tornado and rebuilt green &#8212; view <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/02/09/274227035/kansas-mayor-says-sustainability-is-about-community-not-politics\" target=\"_blank\">sustainability as part of their conservative heritage</a>.</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s good for Americans</h2>\n<p>Why are so many conservatives supporting clean energy? The beauty of clean, green energy is that it <strong>provides clear benefits to Americans</strong>. That includes advantages like <a href=\"http://www.pvsolarreport.com/obama-orders-federal-government-20-percent-renewables-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">increased national security</a>. But it also hits closer to home. With solar on their roof, for example, homeowners can save money on their electric bills.</p>\n<p>Simply put, renewable energy is good for America. That&#8217;s why <a href=\"http://www.lcv.org/assets/docs/presidential-candidates-on-renewable.pdf\">almost every presidential candidate</a> this year supported it in some way.</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s a strong American industry</h2>\n<p>China may be producing large quantities of inexpensive solar panels, but the solar industry is going strong in America. Jobs in the industry are growing over <a href=\"http://mydomino.dreamhosters.com/coal-miners-can-become-solar-workers/\">12 times faster</a> than in the rest of the economy. In 2015 there were <strong>over 208,000 people working in the solar industry</strong>, and that number is growing every day.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just solar that&#8217;s employing Americans. As of early this year, the wind industry supported <a href=\"http://www.awea.org/MediaCenter/pressrelease.aspx?ItemNumber=8736\" target=\"_blank\">88,000 U.S. jobs</a>.</p>\n<h2>It can work for you</h2>\n<p>Are you interested in supporting this American industry &#8212; while helping yourself and our environment?</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a homeowner, adding solar panels might make sense for you. <strong>Contact a <a href=\"http://mydomino.com/?utm_source=bff_blog&amp;utm_medium=bff_article&amp;utm_campaign=bff_GreenEnergyRedWhiteBlue\" target=\"_blank\">MyDomino energy savings concierge </a></strong>to find out if you&#8217;re a good candidate for solar.</p>\n<p>Even if you can&#8217;t go solar, you can help support clean, green energy.

After learning about the dangers of global warming in elementary school, Brian knew that he wanted to make a difference. Brian is particularly interested in how renewable energy technologies can be used to reduce carbon emissions. This brought him to San Francisco, where he began writing for PV Solar Report. He was subsequently published on Solar Power World and The Energy Collective. Brian is now expanding his work to all things clean energy with MyDomino.",
