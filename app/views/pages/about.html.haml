            Why Domino
          %p
            We care about the planet, and we care about our customers. Which is why Domino cuts through the confusion to make going green easy and affordable for everyone.
          %p
            With more environmentally friendly choices than ever, we understand that you’re overwhelmed with options. At Domino, we’ll help you with everything from getting and comparing solar quotes to finding the right electric car to picking the right LED light bulbs for your home.
          %p
            Domino concierges are not salespeople and do not work on commission. So we’ll never pressure you to do something you aren’t sure about. Our team helps you take actions that make sense for you.
